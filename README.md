## Learning from imbalanced insurance data

1. Import required libraries
2. Locate the dataset
3. Read the dataset
4. Check for non numerical features
5. Convert non-numerical features into numerical features
6. Check Correlations and remove redundant features based on the correlation with the target variable
7. Check class imbalanceness
8. Null imputation
9. Train test split
10. Calculate feature importance from X_train and remove unnecessary features from both X_train and X_test
11. Scale and center the data
12. Model selection based on `cross_val_score`
13. Hyperparameter tuning for selected model
14. Apply sampling techniques
15. Model train and test with best hyper parameters
